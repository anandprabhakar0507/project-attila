# project-attila
Google Chrome extension that evaluates math expressions in forms.  
Hate having to open a new tab to calculate things?
Now with project-attila, you won't have to! Simply surround the expression you wish to evaluate with  
backticks (the character under the tilde `) and a draggable interface will appear with the evaluation of your expression shown on the right side.
